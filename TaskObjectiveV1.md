# Task description

Task is splitted into two parts:

1 Part: There is an .net application (controller, service and program.cs), which in the future may be hosted in Cloud. Additionally the application must be able to handle heavy workload - app performance is important. Please setup local environment and try to run the solution. The purpose of this part is to fix some of the problems with the implementation:
- First of all, build of this solution is not possible in current shape
- Read and understand the context of application
- There are some bugs which must be fixed
- For some of the functionalities there are comments that describes the result of the functions (Authorization Handler)
- Focus on the performance aspects
- Change implementation/methods if you think that current implementation is invalid/may cause a performance issues in the future
- Final score of this part also is based on the code quality and best practises of programming

2 Part: There is a docker image which is not perfect, please fix issues of this image to be able to run dockerized application from part 1.
